# React Redux Boilerplate - Framework7 example

## Introduction

> Example of [React Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/kiki-le-singe/react-redux-boilerplate) using [Framework7](http://framework7.io/).

> `This example is not finished, there are some features to implement`.

> The implementation of `Framework7` with `React` is cool but not perfect. It is difficult to combine them together to 100%. You can see one of my problems: [Is it possible to prevent deleting of a DOM element from `F7`?](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/859). So you should probably do a choice at one point... Use both tools or separately... But I think it's possible to do something awesome with this two tools.

> Enjoy it! :)
